## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This portfolio is designed to be **minimalist yet interactive**. 
- **Modern Aesthetic:** Built using **Tailwind CSS 4** and **Next.js 15** for a bleeding-edge web experience.
- **Fluid Motion:** Leverages **Framer Motion** for smooth, context-aware transitions and expandable sections.
- **Glassmorphism:** Uses subtle backdrop blurs and card-based layouts to create depth and focus.
- **Theme-able:** Features a custom-built "Sunset Orange" theme that adapts to both light and dark modes.

## 🛠️ The Engine Under the Hood

- **Frontend:** React 19, Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI Primitives.
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (including layout animations for expandable cards).
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes for server-side logic (e.g., Contact Form).
- **Integrations:** Brevo for automated email notifications.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### Featured Projects
- **FlowCatalyst:** A no-code automation platform built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Turborepo.
- **EzCart:** A full-stack e-commerce solution integrated with Stripe for secure payments.
- **Weather Dashboard:** A real-time forecasting app using the OpenWeather API.

### Open Source Contributions
I am a firm believer in the power of open source. This portfolio highlights my contributions to:
- **Activepieces:** All-in-one AI automation designed to be extensible through a type-safe pieces framework 
- **Mockoon:** The easiest and quickest way to design and run mock APIs.
- **Shiki:** Collection of TextMate grammars and themes, converted to JSON and re-distributed as npm packages.
